# Introduction to Lesson

Welcome back to the Ruby programming course, lesson 2!

In the last lesson, we got acquainted with Ruby and Sinatra, and wrote some very simple programs. In this lesson, we're going to focus on **strings** and their methods. We'll also be looking at how to use variables in IRB. After that we'll write a program that greets a user, as well as a Madlibs game. Then we'll finish off by using Sinatra to make web versions of these programs.
